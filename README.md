# blossom_upload_queue_shim_for_ndk

Offline-first wrapper around the [`ndk`](https://pub.dev/packages/ndk) package's
Blossom upload use case.

NDK's `blossom.uploadBlob` ships a blob to a set of Blossom servers and reports
per-server results. If every server is unreachable (flaky network, app
backgrounded, process killed mid-upload), the blob is gone from the caller's
perspective. This shim sits in front of `ndk.blossom.uploadBlob` and adds:

- **Local persistence first.** The queue entry is committed to a sembast store
  and the bytes are pinned in a [`blossom_cache`](https://pub.dev/packages/blossom_cache)
  before any network attempt. `upload()` returns once persistence is durable;
  delivery happens in the background and survives restarts.
- **100 % delivery guarantee.** An entry is only marked `delivered` once
  *every* targeted server has returned `success: true`. Partial success keeps
  the entry pending and retries the missing servers.
- **Monotonic ack history.** A server that has acked never un-acks. A
  delivered entry never silently flips back to pending due to a transient
  server outage.
- **No auto-deletion.** Delivered entries stay in the store and can be
  re-uploaded later, for instance to a freshly discovered server.

## Install

```yaml
dependencies:
  blossom_upload_queue_shim_for_ndk: ^0.1.0
  blossom_cache: ^0.1.0
  ndk: ^0.8.3
  sembast: ^3.8.7
  idb_shim: ^2.9.2
```

## Quick start

```dart
import 'dart:typed_data';

import 'package:blossom_cache/blossom_cache.dart';
import 'package:blossom_upload_queue_shim_for_ndk/blossom_upload_queue_shim_for_ndk.dart';
import 'package:idb_shim/idb_io.dart';
import 'package:ndk/ndk.dart';
import 'package:sembast/sembast_io.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  final db = await databaseFactoryIo.openDatabase('blossom_uploads.db');
  final cache = await IdbBlossomCache.open(factory: idbFactorySembastIo);

  final ndk = Ndk(
    NdkConfig(eventVerifier: Bip340EventVerifier(), cache: MemCacheManager()),
  );

  final outbox = OfflineBlossomUpload.withNdk(ndk, cache: cache, db: db);
  outbox.start();

  // Bytes go in the cache first, with a caller-supplied sha256.
  await cache.put(mySha256, myBytes, type: 'image/png');

  // Returns as soon as the queue entry is persisted. Delivery is now the
  // shim's responsibility.
  await outbox.upload(
    sha256: mySha256,
    servers: const ['https://blossom.primal.net', 'https://cdn.satellite.earth'],
  );
}
```

## Semantics

### `upload(sha256:, servers:, contentType:)`

Persists a queue entry for the blob identified by `sha256` and schedules an
immediate attempt to push it to every URL in `servers`. The blob bytes must
already live in the `BlossomCache` passed to the constructor. `upload()`
looks them up via `cache.head(sha256)` and throws `StateError` if absent. The
`servers` list is **required**; no automatic server-list lookup is performed.
URLs are normalized (lowercased, trailing `/` stripped) before storage.

If a record with the same `sha256` already exists, the server lists are
merged. `deliveredAt` is preserved if every server in the merged list is
already in the entry's ack set; otherwise the entry is demoted to pending so
the missing servers get pushed.

If no `contentType` is provided, the shim reads it from the cache descriptor.

### `retryNow()`

Forces an immediate scan of due entries, bypassing the online check. Use it as
an explicit override (e.g. when the user pulls to refresh).

### Connectivity awareness

`OfflineBlossomUpload.withNdk()` subscribes to
`ndk.connectivity.relayConnectivityChanges` and pauses the periodic retry
timer while no public relay is connected. Blossom has no dedicated
connectivity stream, so the shim treats "a relay is reachable" as a proxy for
"the device has internet." Loopback addresses, RFC1918 IPv4, ULA/link-local
IPv6, and mDNS `.local` names are excluded from the "is online" computation
so a local dev relay cannot mask a real outage.

For non-NDK setups, pass any `Stream<bool> onlineSignal` to the default
constructor:

```dart
OfflineBlossomUpload(
  uploadFn: ...,
  cache: cache,
  db: db,
  onlineSignal: yourConnectivityStream, // true while online, false otherwise
);
```

If you don't pass anything, the shim assumes it is always online and the
periodic timer runs unconditionally.

### `reupload(sha256, {String? server})`

`ackedServers` and `deliveredAt` are monotonic. `reupload` never rewrites the
past; it queues a one-shot push via a transient `forcedServers` override that
the next attempt consumes.

- `reupload(sha256)`: schedules an immediate push to **every** server in the
  entry's `servers` list, including those that already acked. Useful when you
  suspect a server dropped your blob. Acks and `deliveredAt` are preserved
  regardless of the new attempt's outcome.
- `reupload(sha256, server: s)`: pushes to that single server. If `s` is new
  to the entry, it joins the target list and the entry is demoted to pending
  until `s` acks. If `s` was already there, the historical state is preserved.

### Pin ownership

The shim pins the blob in the `BlossomCache` when it takes ownership of an
upload, and releases the pin on `delivered`. **It only releases pins it
applied itself.** If you pinned the blob before calling `upload()` (e.g.
because the same blob is also referenced by something else in your app), the
shim records `pinnedByShim: false` on the queue entry and leaves your pin
alone, both during and after delivery.

A blob whose bytes are deleted from the cache while still pending will have
its next attempt fail with `lastErrors[server] = 'blob bytes missing from
cache'`. The entry stays in the store; the network call is not made.

### What "success" means

The full target set must ack. The shim uses `UploadStrategy.allSimultaneous`
internally so each server is attempted independently; per-server failures do
not affect the others. `firstSuccess` and `mirrorAfterSuccess` are
deliberately not exposed: they would either fail to cover every target or
introduce server-to-server dependencies that complicate the model.

### What the shim does NOT do

- **It never signs.** Whatever bytes you pass are forwarded as-is to
  `ndk.blossom.uploadBlob`, which signs the BUD-01 authorization event using
  the `EventSigner` configured on NDK. The shim has no opinion on signing.
- **It never hashes.** The caller provides the sha256. The cache stores by
  that key. The shim queues by that key.
- **It never requests server-side media optimisation.** `serverMediaOptimisation`
  would re-encode the blob server-side and change the resulting sha256,
  breaking content-addressing. Hardcoded `false`.
- **It never deletes records.** Even after full delivery, the entry stays in
  the database. If you want retention, prune sembast directly.
- **It does not give up.** Without a `maxAttempts` knob, a deterministically
  rejected upload (size too big for the server, blob type not allowed, etc.)
  will retry forever with exponential backoff. Inspect
  `QueuedBlobUpload.lastErrors` and remove manually if needed.

## Tuning

```dart
OfflineBlossomUpload.withNdk(
  ndk,
  cache: cache,
  db: db,
  storeName: 'blob_uploads',                     // sembast store name
  tickInterval: const Duration(seconds: 30),     // periodic retry scan
  initialBackoff: const Duration(seconds: 5),    // backoff floor
  maxBackoff: const Duration(minutes: 30),       // backoff ceiling
  perAttemptTimeout: const Duration(minutes: 5), // give up on a single NDK call after this
);
```

## Testing your integration

`OfflineBlossomUpload` is fully unit-testable without NDK. Pass a custom
`BlobUploadFn` to the default constructor:

```dart
final outbox = OfflineBlossomUpload(
  uploadFn: ({required data, required serverUrls, contentType}) async => [
    for (final s in serverUrls) BlobUploadResult(serverUrl: s, success: true),
  ],
  cache: await IdbBlossomCache.open(factory: newIdbFactoryMemory()),
  db: await newDatabaseFactoryMemory().openDatabase('test.db'),
);
```

The package's own test suite uses exactly this approach; see
[`test/offline_blossom_upload_test.dart`](test/offline_blossom_upload_test.dart).
